# tiago_grasp_plan
This repository hosts the code base for planning grasps with the TIAGo++ robot. The grasp generation is provided by our method: ORANGE (https://github.com/nickgkan/orange)
The repo will be updated periodically adding more components for planning orientation-invariant grasping actions with the bimanual mobile manipulator robot TIAGO++ using the ORANGE framework.

## Requirements
```
ROS,
Python2.7,
OpenCV bridge,
Pytorch compiled in python2
```
## Videos
SOON: we will provide videos of real-time execution of TIAGo++ planning grasps under ORANGE!

## Acknowledgments
Code was initially adapted by the implementation found in: https://github.com/dougsm/ggcnn_kinova_grasping
